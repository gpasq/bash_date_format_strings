# Bash Date Format Strings

Date formatting is not hard, but it's always a pain in the ass that I have to RTFM then do several tests to make sure I'm getting it right. Here's a simple table of common formatting strings to match what you need.

| Format   |      Command       |   | |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|-|
| 12/15/2021 |  date +%x | MM/DD/YYYY | Locale date |
